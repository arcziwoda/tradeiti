# TradEITI - Application for Course Hour Exchange for Students

## Project Overview

TradEITI is a web application designed to facilitate the exchange of course hours between students. During our first year of studies, we faced the challenge of not having a dedicated platform for students to swap course hours. Until now, students have often relied on primitive solutions such as Google Docs. Our goal is to create a dedicated exchange platform that allows for a more efficient resolution of this issue.

## Technologies

- **Backend**: Built using the Spring framework.
- **Frontend**: Developed with React.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL.

## USOS API Integration

TradEITI integrates with the USOS API to allow students to log in using their existing credentials. This integration enables users to leverage their personal data from the USOS system, streamlining the authentication process and improving the overall user experience.

## Application Features

- **Create New Exchange Offers**: Easily add new course hour exchange offers.
- **Search and Filter Offers**: Use various filters on the homepage to find suitable exchange offers.
- **Manage Offers**: Keep track of your own exchange offers.
- **Accept Offers**: Connect with other students and accept their exchange proposals.

## Migration

This project was originally hosted on a private GitLab server as part of a university project, complete with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment. It has now been migrated to GitHub as part of my portfolio. This migration preserves all historical commit data, branches, and CI/CD configurations, showcasing the evolution and modern development practices applied to the project.
